# module0-appshell

Implement Module 0 app shell on branch `feat/module0-app-skeleton`.

Scope:
- Expo React Native app scaffold (located at `apps/mobile`)
- Orbit + Cockpit navigation (shell only)
- Theme + layout only
- Placeholder components (no real data)

Constraints:
- Follow `.cursorrules` strictly
- Do not compute or infer metrics
- Use placeholders (`"—"`) where data is not wired
- Do not add unsupported operational KPI dashboards/tiles
- Do not introduce new investor-facing narratives/Q&A (copy is locked)

End with a guardrails self-check summary (pass/fail against `.cursorrules`).

This command will be available in chat with /module0-appshell
