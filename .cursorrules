# LEORA INVESTOR OS — CURSOR RULES (LOCKED)

## Non-Negotiables (Logic Lock)
1) NO FINANCIAL MATH in app UI or LLM responses.
   - Never compute revenue, margins, runway, MoM, share price, value multiple, break-even, etc.
   - Only display stored snapshot values from Supabase `metric_values.value_text` or `investor_positions.*_text`.

2) Read-Only Investor OS
   - App is read-only. Authenticated investors can only SELECT.
   - All writes happen only via server scripts using Supabase SERVICE ROLE.

3) Allowed Notion Sources Only (V1)
   - Only these pages are valid sources: 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 18, 19, 21.
   - No other sources may be used or referenced.

4) Forbidden Operational KPIs (V1)
   - Do NOT show or claim these as metrics anywhere:
     - Error Rate / Rework %
     - Design-to-Production Time
     - "Near zero errors"
     - "Faster than market" or market-beating delivery claims
   - LeoX differentiation is STRUCTURAL/NARRATIVE only (Core Thesis), not KPI-based.

## Copy Lock (Do not rewrite)
- "Locked scripts" and Q&A are canonical.
- Do NOT rewrite narrative or investor copy unless explicitly instructed to create a new version (V2+).
- Allowed edits: formatting for UI, headings, spacing, microcopy labels, disclaimers.

## Security / Access
- Use Supabase anon key in the app for reads.
- Use SERVICE ROLE key only in scripts/server tools.
- Enforce RLS so investors can only read their own `investor_positions`.

## Work Style
- Build module-by-module exactly as in MASTER_BUILD_PLAN.
- No scope creep. No new features unless requested.
- Every PR must include a brief "Guardrails Check" note.

## Definition of Done
- Every displayed value traces to a metric_key + snapshot_id + source_page.
- No derived computations in UI or LLM responses.
